    externally. :)

  <div>The objective:</div>
  <div>
    The purpose of this website was to help me log my journey of jobs I applied
    to and to help me further improve my skills for the next interview.
  </div>
  <div>Future Plans:</div>
  <div>
    I want to probably integrate LeetCode progresses, AI NLP to help with any
    questions related to job interviews, pagination, fix the notes section and
    it's formatting, obviously UI/UX design (i suck at this lol) and probably
    quality of life updates.
  </div>
  <div>Backend solutions:</div>
  <div>
    Definitely up on security and scalability as well as optimize api requests
    to supabase. I dont plan on using their storage bucket Postgres doesnt
    support pdf files but there are defintely different alternatives.
  </div>
  <div>TimeLine:</div>
  <div>
    I want to be able to let a few friends use this and see how it goes, its
    probably a funny website to use and provides semi to little usefulness but
    as time goes on hopefully this site receives more updates to better the USER
    EXPERIENCE LOL
